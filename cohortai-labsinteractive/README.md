# CohortAI Labs — Premium Netlify Website (Pearl Theme + Slider + Interactivity)

## Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deploy (Netlify)
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`

## What’s improved in this build
- Much larger logo in navbar + drop-shadow + chip background (better visibility)
- Animated top navigation (slide-in + active underline)
- Hero slider now has padding around images to prevent rounded-corner clipping
- Added `/quiz` (2-minute assessment with score + badge + WhatsApp share link)
- Added a home gallery strip driven by placeholder images (`site.images.gallery`)
- Increased text contrast in many sections for readability

## If logo still looks “small”
Your PNG likely contains extra transparent padding. Fix by uploading a tightly-cropped logo PNG (same URL) to your images repo.
